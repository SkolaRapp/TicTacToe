	There are two main branches, master and develop. When a new feature is 
	made, a new feature branch is made from the develop branch. When a feature
	is completed the feature branch is merged into the develop branch. 
	When it has merged successfully the feature branch should be deleted.
	Before the develop branch can be merged into the master branch it has 
	to pass unit testing.
