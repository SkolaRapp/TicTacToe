# TicTacToe
This TicTacToe project is an assigment for T-303-HUGB class in Reykjavik University Autumn 2017.

## Class Diagram
The initial design included dividing the code of the project into three different layers, UI layer, logic layer and data layer, and each layer has a different function. The UI layer contains all the code that represents what the user can see and should the code be stored in a class called TicTacWeb. The logic layer contains the code of the actual logic of the game and should that be stored in a class called TicTacToe. The Data layer should take care of the database and everything that is associated with it, for example high score. Furthermore, there is an Entity class which contains the information about the player. The class diagram here below explains the initial design of the project.
